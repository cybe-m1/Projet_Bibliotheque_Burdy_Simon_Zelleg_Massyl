## *List of Services*
### *User Service*
- A user can borrow books.
- Users are categorized by age Children < 13, 13 < Teen < 18, 18 < Adult.
- A user can only borrow a maximum of 3 books.
- A child cannot borrow a "teen" or "adult" book.
- A teenager cannot borrow an "adult" book.
### *Authentication*
- Authentication config inside of user service
- Authentication (Register/login) : Spring Security
- You can create an account without being authenticated.
- Once registered, the user receives an access token that he uses to perform all other actions
  the user also receives a refresh token in order to update it
- All other actions should be reserved for authenticated users.
### *Book Service*
- *Bugs* noticed anomalies: when creating a book, the query returns a 500 at times, but by running the query a few times (4-5 times) the book is created correctly
- A book has a category (children (0-13 years), teen (13-18 years), adult).
- A book is associated with the user when it is borrowed
### *Comment Service*
- A user can leave a comment after returning the book.
- The commentary also includes a score from 0 to 5
- It is associated with the book and the user
### *Eureka Sever*
Eureka server to see the status of the different microservices
### *Gateway Service*
A gateway has been set up on port 9191, so that all microservices can be reached on this same port
## *Run Using Docker*
In order to start the databases, and run all microservices using docker, use the following commands
```bash
    # Run eureka server and app gateway
    docker-compose up -d
    # Run User, Book, Comment service and Database
    docker-compose -f apps-docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```
At times, it may be necessary to restart certain micro-services, if the latter is not displayed in the list:
```bash
    # Get list of containers
    docker ps
```
Use this command to restart it
```bash
    docker-compose -f apps-docker-compose.yml restart app-books
```
## *Deploy*
- Creation of images with *Docker*
- Setting up pipelines on *GithubAction*
- Deployment on a VM with public ip *35.195.216.63*
## *Uri For Testing*
A collection file *Biblio_Project.json* has been added to the directory, it contains the most important API calls of the different microservices
## *Creating Databases(Only on local)*
### *Create Databases*
```bash
    create database userservice; -- Creates the new database
    create database bookservice; -- Creates the new database
    create database commentservice; -- Creates the new database
```
### *Create User*
```bash
    create user 'bibliouser'@'%' identified by 'biblio123'; -- Creates the user
```
### *Add Role To User*
```bash
    grant all on userservice.* to 'bibliouser'@'%'; -- Gives all privileges to the new user on the newly created database
    grant all on bookservice.* to 'bibliouser'@'%'; -- Gives all privileges to the new user on the newly created database
    grant all on commentservice.* to 'bibliouser'@'%'; -- Gives all privileges to the new user on the newly created database
```
